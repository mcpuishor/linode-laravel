# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

To connect this local repository to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository named "linode-laravel" under the "mcpuishor" account.
   - Visit: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: linode-laravel
   - Description: A Laravel 12 package for Linode integration
   - Make it Public
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. After creating the repository, GitHub will show commands to push an existing repository. Use the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/mcpuishor/linode-laravel.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. If you're using SSH authentication instead of HTTPS, use this command for the remote:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:mcpuishor/linode-laravel.git
```

4. After pushing to GitHub, you can set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD if desired.
